## Profile

Erik is an experienced technology and business leader, especially within FinTech and communication services.
He is also one of the world's most experienced Erlang developers. He has been programming Erlang since 1994; as a master's student, a doctoral student in the HiPE research group at Uppsala University, a CSO and CTO at Klarna, and now a senior developer in several customer projects. Erik started programming in 1980 and started his first company in 1989.

As one of the very first employees at Klarna Erik started in 2005 as a development manager. Following the company's enormous expansion, Erik's responsibilities grew, and he soon became CTO, a role he combined with active participation in system development. He was the driving force behind the development and design of Klarna's main business system.

The knowledgeable and competent team that Erik built at Klarna created, with a deep understanding of the business model, a distributed financial system with the highest possible accessibility and robustness requirements.
The work included:
- automated risk assessment of credit and fraud
- data modeling and data replication
- robustness and stability
- operational monitoring
- real-time performance optimization

In 2014, Erik went on to start several companies, including Happi Hacking. Since then, with his in-depth knowledge and extensive experience, he has contributed greatly to several projects, for example as a senior developer and architect in a large European blockchain project.

In addition to this, Erik has also written "The BEAM book" and articles about Erlang, presented his research at several academic conferences and workshops, and was awarded the "Erlang User of the Year" during his time in the HiPE research group.
He was also the project leader for the group that developed the first version of Scala and a university lecturer, especially in compiler technology.
